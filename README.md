## Why Use LineaPy?

Data is a strategic asset that enables organizations to deliver new innovations, improve customer experience,
and increase revenue.

But going from development to production is full of friction. Data engineering is a manual and
time-consuming process. A proliferation of libraries, tools, and technologies means data teams
spend countless hours managing infrastructure and repeating tasks. This drastically reduces
the teamâ€™s ability to deliver actionable insights in real-time.

LineaPy creates a frictionless path for taking your data science work from development to production,
backed by a decade of research and industry expertise tackling hyperscale data challenges.

> **Data engineering, simplified.** Your data science artifact works, now comes the cleanup.
LineaPy extracts essential operations from the messy development code in minutes not days,
simplifying data engineering with just two lines of code.

> **You analyze, we productionize.** Productionization is manual, messy, and it requires
software engineering expertise to create clean, reproducible code. LineaPy automatically handles
lineage and refactoring so you can focus on experimenting, analyzing, and modeling.

> **Move fast from prototype to pipeline.** LineaPy automates code translations to save you time
and help you stay focused. Rapidly create analytics pipelines with a simple API &mdash; no refactoring
or new tools needed. Go from your Jupyter notebook to an Airflow pipeline in minutes.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To minimize potential interference with your existing system setup, we recommend
you install LineaPy in a virtual environment using ``venv``, ``conda``, or ``poetry``.

Once the virtual environment is activated, run:

```bash
$ pip install lineapy
```

Or, if using ``poetry``, run:

```bash
$ poetry add lineapy
```

### Quick Start

In an interactive computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook, we often find our work
evolving incrementally. That is, our code takes different turns to reflect our thought stream.
The following exemplifies this type of "dynamism" in interactive computing:

```python
import lineapy

# Define text to display in page heading
text = "Greetings"

# Change heading text
text = "Hello"

# Augment heading text
text = text + " World!"

# Try an alternative display
alt_text = text.split()
```

Now, let's say we have reached the end of our programming session and decided that we like
what we see when we ``print(text)``. As shown above, ``text`` has gone through different
modifications, and it might not be clear how it reached its final state especially given other
extraneous operations between these modifications. We can cut through this by running:

```python
# Store the variable's history or "lineage"
lineapy.save(text, "text_for_heading")

# Retrieve the stored "artifact"
artifact = lineapy.get("text_for_heading")

# Obtain the simplest version of a variable's history
print(artifact.code)
```

which will print:

```
text = "Hello"
text = text + " World!"
```

Note that these are the minimal essential steps to get to the final state of the variable ``text``.
