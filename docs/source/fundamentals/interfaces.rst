Jupyter and IPython
-------------------

To use LineaPy in an interactive computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab or IPython,
launch the environment with the ``lineapy`` command, like so:

.. code:: bash

    $ lineapy jupyter notebook

.. code:: bash

    $ lineapy jupyter lab

.. code:: bash

    $ lineapy ipython

Each will automatically load the LineaPy extension in the corresponding interactive shell application.

CLI
---

We can also use LineaPy as a CLI command. Run:

.. code:: bash

    $ lineapy python --help

to see available options.
