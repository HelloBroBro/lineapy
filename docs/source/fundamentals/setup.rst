Installation
============

Set up Virtual Environment
--------------------------

To minimize potential interference with your existing system setup, we recommend
you install LineaPy in a virtual environment using ``venv``, ``conda``, or ``poetry``.

Install Package
---------------

Once the virtual environment is activated, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install lineapy

Or, if using ``poetry``, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ poetry add lineapy

Run with Docker
---------------

(TODO: ADD COMMAND FOR PUBLIC IMAGE IF WE PLAN TO HAVE ONE)
