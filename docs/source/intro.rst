What is LineaPy?
----------------

LineaPy is a Python package for capturing, analyzing, and automating data science workflows.
On a high level, LineaPy traces the sequence of code execution in an interactive computing
environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) to form a comprehensive understanding of the code and
its context. This understanding allows LineaPy to provide a set of tools that help the user
get more value out of their work.
