# LineaPy Examples

We believe examples are the best way to learn something, so we have created hands-on notebooks that illustrate different uses of LineaPy.

- `self-hosting-lineapy`: This demo folder provides an easy to run, local data science development environment that showcases the capabilities of LineaPy. It gives users an easy way to run end-to-end tutorials and prototype solutions to their problems using LineaPy. 

- `tutorials`: These tutorial notebooks focus on walking you through key functionalities of LineaPy with simple examples. If you are new to LineaPy and want to learn the basics, start here!

- `use-cases`: These use-case notebooks contain more realistic examples that show how LineaPy can help data science work in various domains such as real estate, finance, and medicine.
