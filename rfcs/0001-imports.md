# Imports 

The goal of this RFC is to propose a way to improve our way of dealing with imports.

The outline of this RFC is:

1. Overview of how we handle imports now in lineapy
2. Outline some issues with the current approach, with examples
3. Sketch the various features of a required solution
4. Document how other software handles Python imports
5. Propose a concrete solution for lineapy.
